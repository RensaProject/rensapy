1 - Database files all follow Unix naming convention.  Index files are
index.pos and data files are data.pos where "pos" is:

noun
verb
adj
adv

2 - Hyponyms are now classified as either generic or INSTANCES, as
indicated in search output.

current display and search output options settings as user's default
settings.  These settings will be used by default whenever the user
runs the interface.

morphosemantic links.

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\WordNet\2.1\wnres - Graphical interface
					       display options

7 - All nouns are in one tree under "entity" in "noun.Tops".

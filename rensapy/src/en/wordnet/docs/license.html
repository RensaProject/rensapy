               semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
               while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
               the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to
               make reasonable modifications.

               Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created
               through textual modification.
            </p>
            <p><i class="glossterm">Standard Version</i> refers to such a Package if it has not been
               modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the
               Copyright Holder as specified below.
            </p>
            <p><i class="glossterm">Copyright Holder</i> is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights
               for the package.

               Package.
            </p>
            <p><i class="glossterm">Reasonable copying fee</i> is whatever you can justify on the basis of
               media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so
               on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder,
               but only to the computing community at large as a market that must
               bear the fee.)
            </p>
            <p><i class="glossterm">Freely Available</i> means that no fee is charged for the item itself,
               though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means
               that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same
               conditions they received it.
            </p>
            <p>You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
               Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that
               you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated
               disclaimers.
            </p>
            <p>You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
               derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
               modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

            <p>You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
               provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file
               stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do
               at least ONE of the following:

                          archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright

                          a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
                          documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

            <p>You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
               Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
               Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,
               you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
               commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial)
               software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package
               as a product of your own. You may embed this Package's interpreter
               within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as
               a mere form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard
               Version of the interpreter is so embedded.
            </p>
            <p>The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
               output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
               under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated
               them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
               Package. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
               Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
               binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
               neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
               fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you
               do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of
               this Package.
            </p>
            <p>C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages)
               supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to emulate
               subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package
               shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the equivalent
               of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change
               the language in any way that would cause it to fail the regression
               tests for the language.
            </p>
            <p>Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
               permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
               when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces
               visible to the end user of the commercial distribution. Such use shall
               not be construed as a distribution of this Package.
